### Findings

The anlaysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The store sales have been steadily increasing over the past years reaching a noticable peak during 2022. Then there would be a slight drop caused by the change in the taxation for the store in 2023 and thus the increase in product prices.

2. Product Category *Litter Box Cabinet* is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.

3. Most sales occur during the weekend and the best period for sales is at the end of the year, which is expected due to the holidays, and the month of May stands out as a consistently good month (end of spring). 

### Recommendations

- Focus on expanding and promoting products in *Litter Box Cabinet* category.
- Encourage the purchase of products in the first months of the year with a help of coupons and weekly discounts.
